getignore
=========

A simple script to fetch .gitignore files from [Github's repository of them](https://github.com/github/gitignore).

##Installing

To install, run the following code:

```sh
curl http://git.io/jgNS | sudo sh
```

Or, alternatively, clone this repository, and run the install.sh script. You may have to run `chmod +x install.sh` prior to doing so.


##Using

For example, to get the .gitignore for Node.js, just run `getignore Node`.
